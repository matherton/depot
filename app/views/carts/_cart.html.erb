<!-- This is basically our carts/show.html.erb template but using cart instead of @cart. (Note that itâ€™s OK for a partial to invoke other partials.) to avoid repeating myself I have replaced the code in show.html.erb
that cause the partial to be rendered -->
<!-- MA cannot use create.js.rjs in RAILS 3.1 Scott mentioned moustache as alternative (uses curly brackets) - used code on page 150 so cart just appears instead of nice AJAX effect -->
<!-- MA 25-10-11 removed the functionality to disable the cart button as was causing conflicts in GitHUB look in the Ruby-pragmatic-project in GitHub for that source -->
<div class='cart_title'>Your Cart</div> 
<table>
  <!-- MA - this is a partial to place the cart in the sidebar -->
  <%= render(cart.line_items) %>
  <tr class='total_line'> 
    <td colspan='2'>Total</td> 
    <td class='total_cell'><%= number_to_currency(cart.total_price) %></td>
  </tr> 
</table>

<!-- Adds a checkout button to the cart with a new_order_path using the method get so that it gets all the current items -->
<%= button_to "Checkout", new_order_path, :method => :get %>
<!-- Adds a empty cart button to the shopping cart so you completely empty the cart-->
<%= button_to 'Empty cart', cart, :method => :delete, :confirm => 'Are you sure?' %>
